- find if there is an easy bijection between the pPGI expression and
some function of (mu_i, rho_i, delta)

- prove that if a subset is constructed with the greedy heuristic, then
there's not a smaller subset S that meets the condition pPGI(S) > 1 - alpha

- conjecture 1 would still play an interesting role here because it could
save a big part of the computational effort in calculating the pPGI's. Find
a way to use conjecture 1 in the optimal way. Idea:

forming chains with all systems 

chain A: -----

chain B: ---

chain C: --------

chain D: --

chain E: -


we directly compute the pPGI of the first (best) element of every chain and add the
best one to the list. A system can be on two or more chains at the same time, but
it has to be eliminated from all of them when selected.

Pending question: Is there an optimal way to form the chains? (a systems could be,
for instance, the last element in a chain "A" in one setting and in other setting be
a disconnected 1 element chain, but resulting in that chain "A" becomes much larger or
something like that)


TODO:

- check if greedy is the best system of size K

- investigate data structures
